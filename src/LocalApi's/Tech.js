The process is limited by low deposition rates and low kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms. This not only slows the time required to sputter a film, it lowers the purity of the sputtered film.  The Molten Target Sputtering (MTS) method can increase the kinetic energy, the energy latency, and the flux density of sputtered atoms by combining the benefits of both magnetron sputtering and evaporation systems.   It does this by a clever, but simple mechanical modification to the magnetron sputtering gun.  For the MTS method, a simple 1~2mm (depth and width) ring-shaped groove is cut between the magnets in order to keep a gap between the copper plate and the sputtering target.  This effectively is an efficiency increase to a current magnetron based sputtering machine. The ring enhances the magnetic field intensity and increases the temperature of the target material.",

For example, the avian wing geometries of mergansers and owls possess a single layer of feathers extended from an airfoil section of their wings, which improves the global aerodynamic characteristics. Avian wing geometry inspired the concept of a static extended trailing edge (SETE), as shown in Figure 1, where the main airfoil is extended at the trailing edge by attaching a flexible polymer membrane with suitable length and rigidity. Based upon experimental results and CFD simulation it was determined that if SETE was implemented on a fixed wing aircraft, it had the potential to improve cruise flight aerodynamic efficiency up to 10% and reduce fuel consumption up to 5%.",

This solution is added during the first step, consequently improving the next steps in the process primarily by reducing the formation of solid precipitates. The solution reduces the amount of precipitates caused by urinary calcium, sulfate ions, and sulfuric acid; creating less acidic brines. By reducing these precipitates, less surface scaling and clogging occurs in the distillation systems and more potable water can be recovered.

JPL's innovation utilizes highly doped black silicon formed via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching at cryogenic temperatures (i.e., a subtractive process), providing an ultrahigh emissivity surface. This rapid and cost-effective technique yields a uniform etched surface with extremely low reflectivity of visible and infrared (IR) radiation and near-zero transmission, resulting in a high-emissivity surface. Specifically, total emissivity is greater than 99.5 percent for wavelengths between 400 nm and 2,500 nm. This high level of light absorption is possible thanks to the needle-like nanotips (1- to 150-&micro;m long and 0.3- to 5-&micro;m wide, depending upon the parameters utilized) etched into a highly absorbing doped silicon substrate. This dense \"forest\" (typically ~10<sup>6</sup> needles/mm<sup>2</sup>) is completely inorganic. Furthermore, because it is formed by a subtractive process, it does not flake off.",

In order to generate a high-fidelity optical signal, the input electrical signal must be of equally high fidelity, which is a difficult task due to the competing requirements of the digital components and the analog modulator. The digital components required to generate the waveform contain non-idealities which degrade the extinction ratio (ER) of the optical signal.

When the eye smoothly tracks a moving image, the image is smeared across the retina during the frame duration. Although motion blur may be manifest in any moving image, one widely-used test pattern is a moving edge. This pattern gives rise to measurements of what is called moving-edge blur.

The unique feature of this algorithm is the ability to instantaneously adapt the system according to its output, rejecting persistent disturbances, and ultimately improving the systems performance.  This makes the controller ideally suited for applications where there are unknown modelling parameters or uncertain operating environments.  Many aerospace systems must function in unknown or highly variable environments.  This technology allows the system to achieve its objectives in these types of unpredictable environments.  In comparison to current adaptive controller technologies, the addition of residual mode filters allows operation when flexible modes are present that could inhibit the controller. This is especially useful for systems where initial modeling is costly or the fidelity of existing system models is low.",
